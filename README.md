# optimizers-and-regularizations-techniques
This project implements and compares different optimization and regularization methods for an MLP neural network on the Fashion MNIST dataset. It includes implementing five optimization methods and two regularization methods and determining the best architecture for the MLP. The test accuracy of the best model is reported.
